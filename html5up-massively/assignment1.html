								<h3>Project Information</h3>
                                <p>
                                The goal of this first project in the course Computer Aided Management was to create a website. The purpose of the site is to create a space for both myself and the teacher to review future assignments. An added bonus for me is that when the course is complete, I will have my own homepage.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Prior to starting </h3>
								<p>Before I began creating the page I watched the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUZUzCrjMzY&list=PLU4NWxEpJJumoJghcC5V3rjv0_VHE7IQr&index=2">video </a>. The purpose of the video was to show whoever views it how to use pre-made templates to create the page.<br/>
                                I learn best by doing and failing so I thought it best to begin at this point, but retrospectively it would have been wise to gather more information.</p>
                                <h3> Process </h3>
                                <p> Now all I had to do was to choose a template and begin. I chose the template "Strata" because it was sleek and minimalistic (you can see for yourself <a href="https://html5up.net/strata">here</a>). This template provided me with some problems however. I ran into some problems making the page (as it was set up) look good and be funtional at the same time. This caused me to choose another template, called "Massively", and you can find <a href="https://html5up.net/massively">here</a>. I am much happier with this template and plan on using it moving forward.     
                                </p>
                                <h3>Publishing the site</h3>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>Orgianization</h3>
                                <p>An important aspect for me, was that the site would be fully functional and interactive from the go. This required going through the HTML code, and and forming relationships between different parts and files. one example can be seen here below: <br/>
                                <img src="images/Screenshot%20(32).png" alt="" width ="500">
                                This is a screenshot from my Brackets session, an consists of the links in my menu tab. This is one of the many buttons I linked together, with the goal that everything "worked" right from the beginning. <br/>I also added a feature which I find important on a page like this, which is the "Back to top" option, when you find yourself at the bottom of the page.
                                
                                </p>
                                <h3>Features</h3>
                                <p>Some of these may already be mentioned above but I thought best to list them here:
       
                            <ul>
								<li>Fully functional menus</li>
								<li>Every button has a function</li>
								<li>Correct contact info</li>
								<li>Social media linked
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h3>What I looked up</h3>
                                <p>You could call it luck or foresight, but due to the fact that along with the index.html, I also downloaded elements.html, which provided answers to a lot of questions. Additionally, I also figured I could use a lot of what was pre-built into the website and make it my own. Regardless, here below you can find the search terms I  needed answers to during the process: <br/>"how to insert image in html"<br/>"class= image fit thumb edit thumb"<br/>"how to insert hyperlink in html"<br/>
                                "How to create a list in html" <br/>
                                </p>
